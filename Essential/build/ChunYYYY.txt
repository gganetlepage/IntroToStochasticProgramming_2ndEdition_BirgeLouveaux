The
voice 
you 
hear
is 
not 
my 
speaking 
voice
but 
my 
mind's 
voice
.

I 
have 
not 
spoken
since 
I 
was 
six 
years 
old
.

No-one 
knows 
why
.

Not 
even 
me
.

Come 
on
!

My 
father 
says
it 
is 
a 
dark 
talent
,
and 
the 
day 
I 
take 
it
into 
my 
head 
to 
stop 
breathing
will 
be 
my 
last
.

Today 
he 
married 
me 
to 
a 
man
I've 
not 
yet 
met
.

Soon 
my 
daughter 
and 
I 
shall
join 
him 
in 
his 
own 
country
.

My 
husband 
said 
my 
muteness
does 
not 
bother 
him
.

He 
writes 
- 
and 
hark 
this 
-
God 
loves 
dumb 
creatures
,
so 
why 
not
he
?

Were 
good
he 
had 
God's 
patience
...
...
for 
silence 
affects 
everyone
in 
the 
end
.

The 
strange 
thing 
is
I 
don't 
think 
myself 
silent
.

That 
is 
because 
of 
my 
piano
.

I 
shall 
miss 
it 
on 
the 
journey
.

Give 
me 
your 
hand
.

Come 
on
!

You're 
with 
me
!

I've 
got 
the 
lady
.

Easy
! 

It's 
Sunday
.

There 
you 
go
.

Watch 
it
!

There 
you 
are
, 
madam
.

Paddington 
Station
.

Over 
here
, 
me 
lovely
.

Alright
, 
lads
. 
Unbutton
.

I 
could 
piss 
like 
a 
toff
.

Get 
that 
boat 
unloaded
.

Come 
on
! 

First
!

The 
six 
whole 
months
I 
spent 
in 
Dublin
...

Jesus 
Christ
!

Whose 
bloody 
coffin 
is 
this
?
!

Christ
, 
it's 
heavy
!

Hold 
it
!

Yes
, 
yes
. 

Big 
coffin
,
this 
is
!

Fuck 
them
.

We'll 
just 
leave 'em 
behind
.

It's 
what 
they 
fuckin' 
want
.

A 
pox 
on 
you
!

Oh
, 
I 
like 
that
! 

Very 
good
.

Leave 'em 
and 
be 
lynched 
for
the
pleasure
. 

That 
is 
sweet
.

It's 
a 
bit 
rough 
out 
there
.

Could 
be 
they 
can't 
get 
through
to 
you 
in 
this 
weather
.

Do 
you 
have 
things 
for
shelter
?

She 
says 
thank 
you
.

Does 
your 
mother 
prefer
to 
come 
on 
with 
us 
to 
Nelson
?

She 
says 
no
.

She 
says 
she 
would 
rather 
be
boiled 
alive 
by 
natives
than 
get 
back 
on 
your
stinkin' 
tub
.

You
be 
damn 
fortuned
I 
don't 
smack 
your 
puppy 
gob
,
young 
missy
!

Damn 
lucky
!

We're 
all 
ready 
now
, 
sir
.

Mother
, 
watch 
out
!

Oh
, 
hell
! 

Are 
they 
alright
?

Here
.

Look
. 

I'm 
a 
very 
big 
moth
.

Will 
it 
catch 
fire
?

I'm 
not 
gonna 
call 
him 
'Papa'
.

I'm 
not 
gonna 
call 
him
anything
.
